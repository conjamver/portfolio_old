                <p>My passion for Web Development began when one of my first websites was showcased at the Melbourne Museum for VCE Top Designs 2015. A subject I enjoyed at University was my capstone project where I had the role as UX/UI developer and had to design a beauty website for an actual client. I became more experienced when I did placement as a Front-End Developer at the Institute of Physical Activity and Nutrition. It gave me practical experience conducting user panels and building prototypes.</p>

                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>This project required building a fully functional website for the Mellow Me Out brand. My role in the project was UX/UI developer. 
                The main goal was to showcase what the buisiness offers and providing a flexible booking system for the client. The design of the website had
                to be up to date with its competitors. 
                </p>
                <h4>Assertion</h4>
                <p>My role as the UX/UI developer required me creating high-fidelity wireframes in photoshop and then proceeding to code the front-end design using frameworks such as Bootstrap 4 and jQuery. By incorporating usability principles, this ensured that the website would be appealing to the users that want to know more about the business.

                <p>My biggest contribution to the project was ensuring that the website outweighed its competitors. The website went through many reiterations to ensure. The first design of the website was constructed primarily of pure CSS and without any frameworks. The main issue was that many elements were a fixed size and it's respomsiveness was inconsistnent.
                </p>
                <p>After discussing about the design of the website during one of the meetings, I took the role to recreate the whole front-end design using the bootstrap 4 framework.

                <p>Throughout the course of this project, it has had a strong impact on my communication and self management skills. Voice call meetings were conducted atleast once every week to ensure how the team was going with the current sprint. My contribution to the meetings were discussing ideas that may help the website, following up the progress of website and what tasks that needed to be completed. I also got practical experience using project management software such as Trello Board which helped delegate task effectively and keep track of bugs.

                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>My contribution to the project ensured that the front-end design would engage users. I believe that my knowledge on website frameworks such as jQuery and Bootstrap 4 have expanded. As for the future, I feel confident and ready in pursuing a web development job where I can apply these technologies to assist me in making professional and responsive websites. </p>
