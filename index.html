                <p>My passion for Web Development began when one of my first websites was showcased at the Melbourne Museum for VCE Top Designs 2015. A subject I enjoyed at University was my capstone project where I had the role as UX/UI developer and had to design a beauty website for an actual client. I became more experienced when I did placement as a Front-End Developer at the Institute of Physical Activity and Nutrition. It gave me practical experience conducting user panels and building prototypes.</p>

                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>This project required building a fully functional website for the Mellow Me Out brand. My role in the project was UX/UI developer. 
                The main goal was to showcase what the buisiness offers and providing a flexible booking system for the client. The design of the website had
                to be up to date with its competitors. 
                </p>
                <h4>Assertion</h4>
                <p>My role as the UX/UI developer required me creating high-fidelity wireframes in photoshop and then proceeding to code the front-end design using frameworks such as Bootstrap 4 and jQuery. By incorporating usability principles, this ensured that the website would be appealing to the users that want to know more about the business.

                <h5>Assertion A</h5>
                <p>My biggest contribution to the project was ensuring that the website outweighed its competitors. The website went through many reiterations to ensure the best quality content for the user. The first design of the website was constructed primarily of pure CSS and without any frameworks. The main issue was that many elements were a fixed size and its responsiveness was inconsistent.
                </p>
                <p>After discussing about the design of the website during one of the meetings, I took the role to recreate the whole front-end design using the bootstrap 4 framework. My favourite aspects about the framework are the grid structures which allowed me to create responsive pages automatically.
                </p>
                
                 <p>Sprint 4 was the final sprint which involved refining the design of sprint 3. Such aspects included making sure that the client-side feedback messages did not interfere with the web page structure and encapsulating content using cards. 
                </p>

                 <h5>Assertion B</h5>
                <p>My next major contribution to the project was to provide interactive functionality using JavaScript. By applying interactive elements, it has taught me how to select elements in the DOM and applying CSS changes.
                <p>
                    One example of interactivity was the products page. It featured animated collapsible content using jQuery’s slide functions, jump to links that animated the scroll to a specific position and badges that counted the number of items in a specific category. The implementation of these interactive functions was for reasons of usability. The collapsible content allowed the user to have flexibility with their visibility of the products page by hiding unwanted content.

                <h5>Assertion C</h5>
                <p>Throughout the course of this project, it has had a strong impact on my communication and self-management skills. Voice call meetings were conducted at least once every week to ensure how the team was going with the current sprint. My contribution to the meetings was discussing ideas that may help the website, following up the progress of the website and what tasks that needed to be completed. I also got practical experience using project management software such as Trello Board which helped delegate task effectively and keep track of bugs.

                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>My contribution to the project ensured that the front-end design would engage users through a consistent and modern design. I believe that my knowledge on website frameworks such as jQuery and Bootstrap 4 expanded to a professional level where I feel confident to create responsive designs. The experience of using the Bootstrap 4 framework has given me experience in creating mobile first designs and jQuery has taught me to manipulate and understand the DOM structure. </p>

                <p>
                    My web development skills was furthur developed during the 3 to 4 months at the Institute of Physical Activity and Nutrition. The project called SAVLIO required me to design prototypes for a health based intervention platform for users who are suffering from diseases such as Cardiovascular disease. 
                </p>
                <h4>Assertion</h4>
                <p>Similar to the role of my Capstone Project, being a front-end developer required me to design many prototypes. The difference is that it required many reiterations over the designs based off feedback during our daily meetings with the supervisor. Reiterations were also based off data from conducting the user panels which ensured that the usability of the interface was tailored to the older audience.

                <h5>Assertion A</h5>
                <p>
                    Most of the work conducted during Placement involved designing many different types of user interfaces. The first interface involved having the illusion of a single page application by using jQuery functions for showing and hiding content. The issue discussed in the meetings was that the user could get lost as they navigated deeper. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
            An alternative approach to the single page application design was to animate the scroll of the page as a user clicked on a link. There were many reasons to go this approach as it gave visibility of how the user got from one point to another and it gives a sense of direction down to the goal. This was achieved using JavaScript to get a position of an element and then animating the scroll to that position as the user clicks on a link.

                    Overall, I gained experience in ways to animate navigation using JavaScript/jQuery as well as content manipulation of the DOM. The linear progression helps the user know where they travelled from on the web page.

                   User panels were conducted where we had our target audience come to participate in practical activities. The first activity involved having cut outs of popular icons used on the web and writing on the back of them. The next activity had the user commentate over the design aspects of similar websites and finally, the prototypes were shown to the user to see which one they like the most.

                  The user panel was an interesting experience for me as I got to see how a different group of users interpret design elements today. Most users did not know what the calendar icon meant because there were not enough days in the icon itself. This answer was considered in the final prototype design where the calendar Icon had to have a few tweaks.

                Overall, the user panel gave me insight on activities that I can use in the future. It challenged my communication skills by carefully structuring my questions into discrete choice models.

                    My primary contribution to placement involved constructing prototypes based of research and design guidelines. In contrast to the capstone project, I explored many ways to incorporate JavaScript interactivity which helped me understand the HTML DOM structure. Being part of a user panel was a new challenge, but it has assisted me with communication and having attention to their ideas. I gained a better understanding of user panels from this experience.
