                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>This project required building a fully functional website for the Mellow Me Out brand. My role in the project was UX/UI developer. 
                The main goal was to showcase what the buisiness offers and providing a flexible booking system for the client. The design of the website had
                to be up to date with its competitors. 
                </p>
                <h4>Assertion</h4>
                <p>My role as the UX/UI developer required me creating high-fidelity wireframes in photoshop and then proceeding to code the front-end design using frameworks such as Bootstrap 4 and jQuery. By incorporating usability principles, this ensured that the website would be appealing to the users that want to know more about the business.

                <h4>Interpersonal Skills</h4>
                <p>Throughout the course of this project, it has had a strong impact on my communication skills. Voice call meetings were conducted atleast once every week to ensure how the team was going with the current sprint. My contribution to the meetings were discussing ideas that may help the website, following up the progress of website and what tasks that needed to be completed.
